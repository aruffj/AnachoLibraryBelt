# Anarchist Library Belt

*A fork of Astrrra's [Anarcho Earrings](https://github.com/Astrrra/AnarchoEarrings) as requested by MNHarold*

Hi all, as promised here's a little easy guide on how to make your own portable WiFi anarchist libary. I will try to make it as easy and accessible as possible - if anything is unclear feel free to reach out to me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/aruffj_).

This guide aims to leave you with a fully working Anarcho Library Belt, however it does not try to teach you programming. 

What we need:
* An ESP8266 or ESP32 Microcontroller
* A Micro-USB Cable
* A PC (Linux/Win/Mac) - A raspberry pi would do. 
* The Arduino IDE
* Some electrical tape
* A USB Powerbank

**Note**: You can simply search for the ESP32/ESP8266 online and buy them. The ESPs are a so called "Micro Controller" which allows you to programm it. You should be able to get one cheap (Less then 5â‚¬) new, I however recommend you also check your local "used stuff" site. :)

## Step 1: Setting up

Alright - let's go!

1. Take your ESP and connect it to your PC with an USB cable. There should be an LED lighting up indicating that it's connected.
1. Now we have to download the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Envoirement) to connect to the micro controller and send it the required data. You can download it for free from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). If you are using Linux you will want to use your package manager instead of the website.
1. Install the IDE as usual (Windows: Double click the .exe file you downloaded, Mac: Unpack the .zip file to software)
1. Start the IDE. We will have to add some settings. :)
1. Click on `File` -> `Preferences`. In the lower part of the new window you will find `Additional Boards Manager URLs:` -- Copy and paste this: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` (This will allow us to communicate with our Board. :) )
1. Now close the IDE again - we have to do some additional work before we continue there.
1. Visit the [LittleFS](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin/releases) release page and dwonload the `ESP8266LittleFS-2.6.0.zip`. This will allow us to upload the actual Anarchist FAQ to the Board.
1. Open the Zip-File and extract the contents to
    * Linux: `~/Arduino/tools/`
	* Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\tools` (Your PC might ask you if you really want to here, say "Yes")
	* Mac: Create the tools folder in `~/Documents/Arduino` and unpack the files there
1.
